Tips:
1) Admin pages are rendered by the class Volunteer_Management_And_Tracking_Admin in admin/class-volunteer-management-and-tracking-admin.php
1a) class functions beginning with html_page_... are the full admin pages hooked with 'admin_menu'
2a) class functions beginning with html_part_... are the partial html pieces used by the admin pages to render various views
2) functions that could potentially be used by both Admin and Public sides are found in the class Volunteer_Management_And_Tracking_Common in common/class-volunteer-management-and-tracking-common.php
3) Public side functionality and page rendering is done in the class Volunteer_Management_And_Tracking_Common in public/class-volunteer-management-and-tracking-public.php
4) The repository for defining what is hooked into WordPress for both public and private is the class Volunteer_Management_And_Tracking in includes/class-volunteer-management-and-tracking.php
5) CSS and JS scripts are enqueued in the enquque_styles() and enqueue_scripts() functions in the Public and Admin classes. 
6) needed files are "require_once'd" in the load_dependencies() function of the class Volunteer_Management_And_Tracking in includes/class-volunteer-management-and-tracking.php
7) Total plugin boilerplate was created using the make_wp_boilerplate script in ~/bin, which uses the git repository wp-plugin-boilerplate as a basis for creating the framework
